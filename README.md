# Turtle

This repo contains a number of applications using [turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Geometry) to generate patterns and fractals. Many of the programs are taken from Hans Zantema's paper [Turtle grapohics of morphic sequences](https://www.win.tue.nl/~hzantema/turtle.pdf).

A discussion of turtle graphics and how the NÃ¸rgaard fractals were generated are available on my [website](https://www.jonaslindstrom.dk/?p=682).
